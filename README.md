Hi there, I'm Talukdar üëã

I'm a web developer with expertise in HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap-5, Tailwind, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. I love creating beautiful and responsive web applications that are fast, secure, and easy to use.

Over the years, I have gained hands-on experience in developing complex web applications using modern web technologies. I have worked on both front-end and back-end development, and I am comfortable working in a team or independently.

My goal is to continue improving my skills and knowledge as a web developer, and to help others along the way. I believe in the power of open source and contributing back to the community, and I'm always looking for new projects and collaborations.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading about new web technologies, playing video games, and spending time with my family and friends.

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-abdullah-talukdar) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/talukdermuhammad13) to connect and chat about web development or anything else!
